# Project Ideas using Blockchain

## Beginner

1. Simple Blockchain Implementation: Build a basic blockchain from scratch to understand the core concepts of blocks, hashing, consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work), and Merkle trees. You can find resources like [Blockchain Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/golang/) to guide you.

2. Crypto Wallet: Develop a basic crypto wallet application using Golang that allows users to generate keys, manage funds, and interact with a test blockchain network (like Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric).

## Intermediate

1. Decentralized Marketplace: Create a marketplace application for buying and selling digital goods using smart contracts. This project will involve writing smart contracts in Solidity (Ethereum) or chaincode (Hyperledger Fabric) and integrating them with your Golang application.

2. Supply Chain Tracking: Build a blockchain-based system for tracking the movement of goods through a supply chain. This could involve recording information like origin, location, and ownership changes for each item.

## Advanced

1. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Develop a DAO framework in Golang that allows users to create and manage organizations governed by smart contracts. This is a complex project that requires a deep understanding of smart contract development and blockchain governance models.

2. Scalable Blockchain Platform: Explore building a scalable blockchain platform using Golang libraries like Tendermint or Coda Protocol. This is a highly ambitious project that delves into the world of consensus mechanisms beyond Proof of Work.
